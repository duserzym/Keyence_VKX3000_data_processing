# Keyence_VKX3000_data_processing
 This is a repository with handy Python functions for reading and processing Keyence VKX-3000 profilometer data (VK4 and VK6 file format). 

 The core functions are converted from the c code in the Gwyddion software package: https://gwyddion.net/; the functions for parsing the Vk4 files come from the `vk4-python-driver` Github repository: https://github.com/torkian/vk4-python-driver.
